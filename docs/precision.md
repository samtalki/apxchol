# Precision and factor storage

Precision is chosen separately for graph storage, the assembled factor, the
installed triangular-solve arrays, and the outer iteration. A build with
`APXCHOL_POOL_FP32=OFF` is not an all-FP64 solver.

| Stage | Representation | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Mutable residual graph | FP32 weights by default; optional FP64 weights | Storage/bandwidth versus rounding during factor construction |
| Assembled factor | FP32 values | Shared factor/export representation |
| CPU triangular solves | FP32 storage by default; optional scaled FP16 off-diagonals | FP16 requires efficient conversion; CPU arithmetic remains FP64 |
| GPU triangular solves | Scaled FP16 off-diagonals by default; FP32 alternative | Reduced value traffic; GPU triangular-solve arithmetic is FP32 |
| FP16 scales and diagonals | FP32 | Retain scale range and diagonal quality |
| Outer CPU/CUDA PCG | FP64 vectors and reductions | Preserve the original-system iteration and residual accuracy |
| Metal triangular solves | The CPU's FP32 stored factor; FP32 reciprocal diagonals and arithmetic | Apple GPUs have no FP64; same applied preconditioner as the CPU |
| Metal block PCG | Double-float x, r, A p and inexact operator; FP32 p and z; double-float fixed-tree reductions; host FP64 exit residual | About 48-bit recurrences reach original-system tolerances without FP64 hardware |

`APXCHOL_SPTRSV_FP16=0|1` selects triangular-solve storage at setup. CPU FP16
is available only on targets with F16C; it is not promised by portable wheels.
The GPU operator may use FP32 storage when the original values are exactly
representable; this is separate from narrowing a preconditioner.

## Scaled FP16 contract

For each column, let `s_j` be the maximum absolute off-diagonal factor value,
or one for an empty/zero off-diagonal column. The factor-drop threshold uses
this scale before dropping. Drop compensation runs on FP32 values before
narrowing; the retained values preserve the column sum up to rounding.

An off-diagonal is stored as round-to-nearest-even FP16 of `L_ij / s_j`.
FP16 subnormals are flushed to signed zero. The scaled diagonal remains FP32
and absorbs the off-diagonal rounding residual. Degenerate scales fall back
to one before dropping; invalid final diagonals/scales are rejected.

Writing the scaled factor as `L D^-1`, the forward sweep returns `D y` and
the backward sweep applies the reciprocal scale squared to its input. CPU
arithmetic widens to FP64, GPU triangular-solve arithmetic to FP32. A stored
FP16 factor is not an FP16 outer solve. CPU and GPU-host preparation share the
narrowing/flush rules in `lowprec.h`; device finalization has its own CUDA
implementation and is checked by the GPU finalization tests.

## Apple Metal block PCG

`apxchol::metal_solver` (`APXCHOL_USE_METAL=ON`, macOS) is an explicit opt-in;
`solve()` and `cpu_solver` are unchanged.

- **Preconditioner.** The same L11, compacting drop (`APXCHOL_FACTOR_DROP`) and
  FP32 values as the CPU's FP32 storage; the schedule arrays are byte-identical
  to `omp_sptrsv`'s CSR/CSC. Diagonals are applied as `fp32(1 / fp64(L_ii))`.
  Arithmetic is FP32 fused multiply-add in dependency order; a row with more
  than 32 dependencies accumulates them in 32 fixed virtual lanes folded in
  order. `APXCHOL_SPTRSV_FP16` is ignored: the device always stores FP32.
- **Recurrences.** x, r and A p are double-float (hi + lo FP32, about 48
  significant bits). The operator is FP32 when every value is FP32-exact and
  double-float otherwise (the CPU/CUDA exactness rule, without an override).
  p and z are FP32; alpha and beta are FP32. Every reduction (p.Ap, r.r, sum r,
  r.z, sum z) is double-float on one fixed tree that depends only on n.
- **Scaling and stopping.** Each right-hand side (or b - A x0) is scaled by an
  exact power of two so that its largest entry lies in [1, 2). The threshold
  (tol ||b|| s)^2 is formed on the host in FP64 and compared as a double-float
  with strict `<`. Breakdown (p.Ap <= 0 or non-finite) is not convergence and
  its iteration is not counted.
- **Reported residual.** ||b - A x|| / ||b|| is recomputed on the host in FP64
  against the caller's operator (canonical lower values, as the CPU operator)
  on the returned x; `converged` means it is below tol. The device's recursive
  residual is reported separately and is not the acceptance criterion. With
  about 48 bits in the recurrences and operator, the attainable original-system
  residual is limited to roughly 2^-48 || |A| |x| || / ||b||; within that margin
  of tol a column can stop on its recursive residual and still report
  `converged = false`.
- **Laplacians.** Every preconditioner application is centred (input and
  output means in double-float); the CPU's `APXCHOL_CENTER_K` schedule does
  not apply. The returned x is centred once more on the host in FP64.
- **Reproducibility.** For one factor, a column's solution and iteration count
  are bit-identical run to run and independent of the batch width, the other
  columns, the column's position and the host OpenMP team (host folds use
  fixed 4096-entry blocks). Not promised across devices, OS or Metal compiler
  versions, nor equal to CPU or CUDA results. Independent parallel
  factorizations remain a separate question, as above.
- **Compilation and range.** Kernels are compiled at run time with
  `MTLMathModeSafe`, precise math functions and `#pragma METAL fp contract(off)`
  when accepted; `metal_solver::available()` also requires a device self-test
  of the double-float operations to match the host bit for bit. Nonzero
  operator and factor magnitudes must lie in [2^-100, 2^100]
  (`std::domain_error` otherwise), and the factor's stored entries and the
  two-triangle operator must fit the device's 32-bit offsets (at most 2^30
  stored operator entries; `std::length_error` otherwise).

## Accuracy and configuration choice

FP16 applies to the installed triangular-solve arrays, not the mutable graph
or assembled/exported factor. Graph weights use FP32 by default; FP64 pool
storage is an optional reference. Scaled FP16 graph storage is not supported.

Low-precision preconditioning can retain final solution accuracy while changing
iteration count. Select precision using original-system residuals, total solve
cost and memory on the intended inputs; smaller storage alone is not a speed
guarantee. Bitwise factor repeatability is a separate property from convergence.

A fixed factor seed determines the per-vertex random streams, but does not
promise byte-identical independently rebuilt parallel factors. Thread arrival
order can change floating-point sums, which can change sampled edges as well as
factor values. FP32 rounding may hide some differences that FP64 retains; neither
precision makes floating-point addition independent of order. FP16 factor storage
is applied later and does not make factor construction deterministic.

For the same graph, candidates, selector state and actual thread team, selection
must preserve its selected set and insertion order. Tests also retain exact
single-thread factor and same-owned-factor repeated-solve checks. Parallel FP64
rebuilds are checked for valid structure and the requested original-system
residual, rather than equal factor bytes or iteration counts between builds.
This also applies to explicit host factor construction in CUDA-enabled builds.
Low-level import of that factor onto the GPU does not make its earlier
construction repeatable; public CPU solvers keep the factor and solves on CPU.

Historical rejected precision variants and their limits are recorded in
[implementation history](implementation-history.md). They are not universal
precision guarantees. The [benchmark protocol](../benchmarks/README.md) describes
how to compare supported configurations without changing timing boundaries.

## C API CPU exit certification

The C ABI recomputes the final original-system residual with the CPU solver's
owned operator, after any solution centering. The diagnostic forced-inexact-fp32
operator override retains an additional lossless operator copy for this check;
ordinary lossless fp32/fp64 configurations retain only one copy. Norms use scaling rather than
unscaled sums of squares. The original RHS copy is retained until certification,
including when the output aliases the caller's RHS or initial guess.
`SUCCESS` requires the resulting relative residual to be strictly below the
requested tolerance. Zero RHS returns residual zero only for a zero residual;
non-finite exit arithmetic reports infinity and `NOT_CONVERGED`.

Certification is included in `solve_seconds`, adds no PCG iterations or retries,
and applies independently to every CPU block column. C++ solve methods retain
their existing recursive residual reporting and stopping rule. In particular,
this check prevents false acceptance of tiny inputs but does not make the
underlying PCG recurrence scale-invariant. Metal retains its separately
documented residual calculation and attainable-accuracy limitations above.
Its host norms are unscaled: the C ABI rejects finite nonzero RHS/guess
vectors whose squared norm underflows to zero or overflows with `UNSUPPORTED`.
The direct C++ Metal API still has this extreme-scale limitation.
