## Scope and evidence

Keep this file current when builds, APIs, defaults or architecture change.
Deliver the requested scope; prefer removing redundancy to adding modes or knobs.
Verify claims with current-session evidence; label historical results and hypotheses.
Factor identity requires structure/value digests, not equal fill or residuals.
The [precision contract](docs/precision.md) separates parallel factor rebuilds
from exact same-graph selector and same-owned-factor solve checks. Do not infer
whole-factor bit identity from a fixed seed or lower storage precision.
Audits report the complete denominator, checked/total and exclusions.
Consult [implementation history](docs/implementation-history.md) before changing
an established algorithm/default; historical examples are not current verification.

## Build and tests

The root project builds the library, CLI, and unit tests. The separate
`benchmarks/` project fetches competitor implementations.
CI builds its CPU-only native benchmark and runs the CLI/stopping CTest
contracts alongside the Python harness tests; these checks are not performance
campaigns. Native benchmark sources, CMake files, tests and patches trigger CI.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j6
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/tests/unit_tests --gtest_filter='FactorizeTest/*.PermutationIsValid'
./build/apxchol path/to/matrix.mtx --random-rhs --tol 1e-8
```

CLI input requires `--rhs file.mtx` or `--random-rhs`. Input kind is detected
and reported; `--input-kind` overrides it. Random RHS is projected separately
on each Laplacian component. An explicitly supplied RHS is never altered.

## Benchmark original-system stopping

The `original-v1` benchmark contract checks the defining operator/RHS at native
solve exits, reuses setup for bounded retries, and keeps one total iteration
budget (per component for split solves). Exhaustion is nonconvergence, never a
relaxed acceptance mark. Required stopping checks and retries are included in
Solve; `stop_check_s` is an included diagnostic, not a subtraction. At most eight
attempts/checks prevent zero-iteration loops; no short-plateau rejection rule.
Do not add per-iteration host checks or GPU transfers. Keep native kernels and
first-pass requests intact except documented tolerance-basis conversions.
The internal `detail/gpu_solve_session.h` shares the one-shot GPU setup lifetime
with benchmark retries; it is not a new public solver API. Packed CMG exposes no
reusable hierarchy and must charge/report each setup. ParAC patch 0007 replaces
untimed calibration with measured original checks. Current runners reject old
stopping receipts/caches; preserve historical results without relabelling them.

## Remote campaign gate

Platform/account/access details and job histories belong in private campaign
plans, not this repository's user documentation. Historical benchmark pages do
not establish current cluster availability. Follow the user's authorized host,
connection and resource limits; do not invent an alternate authentication route.

Every new or materially changed campaign follows these gates in order:

1. Freeze immutable source/package bytes and the complete planned denominator.
   State the hypothesis, CPU/GPU/memory/walltime ceiling, cancellation command,
   stopping rule, and infrastructure versus scientific-rejection exit policy.
2. Run bounded login preflight through the same prologue used by batch. Check
   canonical source/dependency/input hashes, clean tracked/untracked/ignored
   state, fresh external namespaces, exact target interpreters and all entry
   points. Reject generated caches before imports. Exercise missing, empty and
   zero Slurm variables. Compile/link tiny probes with the exact C/C++/CUDA/host
   compilers and flags, verify CMake cache values and runtime linkage, and test
   analyzers against success/failure fixtures. No heavy builds or timing here.
3. Authenticate the trust root and helpers before executing package Python.
   Test tampering with each and with a mutually consistent replacement. Hash
   one captured byte string rather than hashing then reopening a mutable path.
   Use one finite independent package review, plus a repair-delta review only
   if blocked. A failed smoke becomes an allocation-free regression first.
4. Submit through a package-owned wrapper using absolute external chdir,
   stdout/stderr and source paths; spool paths are not source paths. Pin tools
   and interpreters for their execution environment. Run sbatch --test-only
   with final arguments; distinguish its number from the submitted job ID.
5. Compute smoke builds and runs the exact targets, tiny solver paths, resource
   and observed worker-affinity checks. Bind every named artifact, cache,
   command and runtime identity in receipts derived from hashed output and
   scheduler evidence. Every timing entry point requires the receipt before
   execution. Login OS libraries are not compute-runtime equality evidence.
6. Only after all gates pass may authorized production run. Budget from fresh
   smoke with margin (planned work <= 0.67 of walltime, watchdog >= 3 times a
   measured upper bound); a timeout is not a runtime estimate. Include implicit
   resources, nested steps and actual confinement. Keep source/packages fixed
   after submission. Never duplicate submission or reuse partial namespaces.
7. Collect and hash the full denominator, recheck inputs/source at the end,
   and preserve failed evidence. Reject late provenance/runtime failures before
   publishing aggregates. Keep valid scientific rejections distinct from
   infrastructure failure; do not kill unrelated observations or silently retry.

Keep every measurement in its declared experimental unit when comparing or
resampling. Concurrent ranks are not independent replications. Factor identity
requires structure/value digests; equal fill, residuals or seed are insufficient.
Required original-system checks and retries remain inside Solve. Publish neither
private runbooks nor unaccepted performance conclusions.

## Build options

Current options are declared in the root `CMakeLists.txt`. Historical backend
choices, retired knobs, and measurements belong in
[implementation history](docs/implementation-history.md), not this contract.

- `APXCHOL_BUILD_EXAMPLES` / `APXCHOL_BUILD_TESTS`: ON by default. Only tests
  require GoogleTest. `APXCHOL_BUILD_TOOLS`: OFF by default, independently builds
  `build/tests/bench_setup` and `build/tests/analyze_factor`, including when tests
  are disabled. `analyze_factor MATRIX --solve [--seed N]` reports setup, solve,
  iterations and the original-system residual for a component-compatible RHS.
- CMake usage requirements on `apxchol_core` and `apxchol_mtx_input` must export
  C++23 and any native architecture flag actually used by the library. Parent
  projects do not inherit directory compile options; mismatched Eigen alignment
  across the library boundary can corrupt allocation ownership. Validate with
  the external parent fixture in `tests/cmake_consumer`.
- `APXCHOL_NATIVE_ARCH`: ON for local builds. Root, benchmark, and local Python
  builds share the architecture-specific compiler probe; portable Python wheels
  omit native tuning. `scripts/rebuild.sh [all|core|bench]` uses CMake dependency
  tracking without touching source files; both build helpers stop on failures.
- OpenMP: `cmake/apxchol_openmp.cmake` (root and Python) uses only standard
  FindOpenMP inputs; there is no apxchol OpenMP option. Apple Clang also
  searches the keg-only Homebrew libomp after caller prefixes. Select a
  runtime with `OpenMP_ROOT`, pin one exactly with `OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS`,
  `OpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES` and `OpenMP_<lib>_LIBRARY`, or request a serial
  build with `CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_OpenMP=ON`. A missing runtime warns.
- macOS: Linux-only `madvise` advice (THP, populate) is compiled out; the
  mmap paths remain. libc++ `std::pmr` requires a macOS 14 deployment target.
  CI runs the parent-consumer suite on macos-15 (Apple Clang + Homebrew
  libomp) and builds an arm64 wheel. macOS wheels bundle LLVM libomp built
  from source for 14.0 (`python/tools/build_libomp_macos.sh`); keep
  `check_macos_wheel.py` and `check_macos_runtime.py` passing.

- `APXCHOL_USE_CUDA=ON`: our dataflow SpTRSV and GPU-resident PCG. The library
  links `cudart` only. There is no cuSPARSE backend or build option. Benchmark
  competitors independently require cuSPARSE/cuBLAS; distinguish their driver
  linkage from our library linkage.
- `APXCHOL_POOL_FP32=ON` (default): fp32 residual-pool weights; OFF selects
  the fp64 residual-pool baseline. Factor values remain
  fp32; fp16 storage is a runtime choice, not another build configuration.
- `APXCHOL_64BIT_EDGE_INDICES=ON`: wide cumulative edge offsets.
  `APXCHOL_64BIT_NODE_INDICES=ON` additionally widens vertices and implies
  wide edges. Do not use the deprecated combined index option in new code.

Run focused regressions, then the relevant full suite; repeat only after changes
or unresolved failures. CUDA correctness requires the appropriate build and device.
Do not time alongside builds or other laptop workloads.

When `compute-sanitizer` is available, CUDA builds register
`gpu_factor_finalize_leak_check`; run it with:
`ctest --test-dir build-cuda -R '^gpu_factor_finalize_leak_check$' --output-on-failure`.
Without it, ordinary tests do not establish leak freedom. Device-wide
`cudaMemGetInfo` equality is not a process-leak assertion.

## Architecture and contracts

- Public headers are under `include/apxchol/`; `include/apxchol.h` is the
  convenience entry point. `src/factorization.cpp`, `src/operator_class.cpp` and
  `src/solve.cpp` provide the CPU compiled core. `benchmarks/src/v0/` is a frozen competitor baseline.
- `include/apxchol/c_api.h` / `src/c_api.cpp` (target `apxchol_c`, not built
  with CUDA) are the exception-safe C ABI over `cpu_solver` for Julia/Rust and
  other non-C++ consumers. Structs carry `struct_size`; defaults come from
  `solve_options{}`; NOT_CONVERGED writes outputs and is never an acceptance;
  `converged` is `residual < tol` as in the PCG loop. `threads` scopes the
  calling thread's OpenMP limit per call. n and nnz are limited to 2^31-1;
  edge-index overflow still aborts. Keep `tests/test_c_header.c` layout asserts
  in step with the header and bump `APXCHOL_C_ABI_VERSION` on layout changes.
- `operator_class.h` and `src/operator_class.cpp` own operator validation and
  M-matrix lumping. `src/mtx_input.h` owns CLI-only interpretation of graph
  adjacency versus an assembled operator. Bindings must use the operator
  contract, not CLI guesses.
- `graph/` provides adjacency layouts. Directed `vec_pool_aos` is the
  default for both high-level solves and `graph<>`; indexed `vec_pool` and
  `forward_star` are retired. The remaining built-ins are AoS, vec and bstr. Changing storage
  must not silently choose a different selector.
  Incremental-degree radix histograms and decrement slices use the actual
  OpenMP team, never unused rows from the requested team size.
  The general pooled graph builder counts and writes logical column ranges
  through OpenMP worksharing; every range must execute even if a nested region
  or thread limit supplies fewer workers than requested. A fresh graph's initial
  reserve must not join an unrelated caller team's collective or barrier.
- `solver/elimination/` owns clique sampling and the public eliminator seam.
  Canonical neighbors use comparison sort by weight and vertex; sampling uses
  exact cumulative weights and `upper_bound`. Preserve estimator semantics,
  tie ordering, and per-elimination random streams.
- Serial residual `min_degree` currently uses a lazy degree heap, not exact
  current-minimum-degree selection. Historical measurements retain that meaning.
  Refreshing degree decreases changes ordering and needs fresh validation;
  neither this heuristic nor exact minimum degree guarantees minimum fill.
- `solver/partition/` contains block-greedy, priority-greedy, and Baumann-Kyng.
  `factor_options.h` is authoritative for defaults and their rationale.
  Preserve deterministic conflict resolution and thread-team fallback rules.
- CPU `solver/sptrsv/omp.h` supports `APXCHOL_CPU_SPTRSV=auto|levels`.
  AUTO uses the structural critical-tail schedule when metadata permits;
  `levels` is the reference. Share row arithmetic across schedules and storage.
  Research schedules on other branches are not production modes.
- CPU SpTRSV's nnz-sized CSR/CSC index and value output buffers use
  `big_alloc<T,32,false,false>`: the transpose/copy fully overwrites them, so
  writer threads perform the first touch. Pointer, diagonal, scale, and other
  allocations retain the populated, value-initialized default. Require a full
  overwrite before first read when using the output-buffer specialization.
- The CPU Laplacian L11 temporary index/value arrays likewise use uninitialized
  owning arrays: the existing column copy writes every retained entry before
  any read. Preserve their early release after compaction or their last use.
- GPU SpTRSV is dataflow-only. The old `APXCHOL_GPU_SPTRSV=dataflow` spelling
  is accepted; other nonempty values are errors. `APXCHOL_SPTRSV_FP16` controls
  factor storage (GPU default on, CPU default off); scales and diagonals stay
  fp32, while outer CPU/GPU PCG vectors and reductions stay fp64. See
  [precision and storage](docs/precision.md). The old GPU-only alias is
  retired. GPU block setup is explicit opt-in
  through `APXCHOL_GPU_BLOCK_FRONTEND=on|force|1`, independent of host threads.
- GPU-owned numerical setup requires all three existing flags:
  `APXCHOL_GPU_BLOCK_FRONTEND=on|force|1`, `APXCHOL_GPU_ROUND_SHADOW=force`
  and `APXCHOL_GPU_FACTOR_FINALIZE=force`. It applies to an internal consuming
  block-greedy/tree solve on directed AoS. It can eliminate supported rounds on
  device and install the append log through dataflow SpTRSV. Public factorization,
  custom strategies, exported factors and `keep_factor=true` retain their audited
  or ordinary host path; copied capsules keep independent ownership validation.
- An eligible compressed, sorted, unique, fully paired symmetric CSC operator
  initializes the owned graph directly after operator validation. Its fresh,
  unchanged operator view supplies the pairing proof only after strict layout
  checks and when all stored off-diagonals are nonzero. Stored zeros, lumped
  inputs and raw/test entry points retain full structural mate checks. Other
  stored formats retain the host import fallback before device mutation. GPU PCG
  constructs the permuted operator CSR on device only with all three existing
  owned-setup flags enabled and its format checks satisfied. Ordinary calls and
  unsupported formats keep host construction. Canonical lower values and
  lossless-fp32 selection are unchanged.
  Preserve original-system residual grading and full fallback validation.
- `operator_scan::triangles_bit_identical` is the proof that lets consumers of
  the caller's operator skip the per-entry transpose-partner search (about
  log2(column length) cache misses per entry, in the hub columns of power-law
  and IPM operators). The scan sets it only for strictly index-sorted columns
  with no explicit-zero or non-finite off-diagonal and equal per-triangle entry
  fingerprints (`detail::symmetric_entry_hash`, `csc_work.h`); it then also
  skips its own partner search, which otherwise runs unchanged as a second pass
  with the same count and witness. `detail::make_graph_from_operator` takes the
  proof only from `factorize_for_solver` and only when nothing was lumped;
  public `make_graph` never assumes it. The owned SpMV copy proves it for itself
  while copying (fingerprint includes the position in a duplicate run) and falls
  back to the pairing loop on any difference. Results are bit-identical with and
  without the proof; keep it that way.
- Loops over the rows or columns of the caller's operator (SpMV, owned copy,
  graph builder) split work with `detail::work_balanced_range`, not by index
  count: equal-count chunks carry 2x (IPM) to 4x (as-Skitter) the mean stored
  entries in the heaviest chunk. The bounds depend only on the pointer array and
  team size, so thread-ordered reductions stay bit-identical run to run. The
  level-scheduled SpTRSV deliberately does not (tried and removed 2026-08-18).
- Prune-walk skip (block-greedy on the directed AoS pool): once AUTO has declined
  the exact incremental-degree cache, skipping rounds report a vertex whose raw
  adjacency count exceeds 4x the previous round's eligibility threshold at that
  count instead of walking it (`prune_and_degrees(..., skip_above)`). Its degree
  is then an upper bound and its dead entries wait for a later walk; that is
  sound only because this path's selector and eliminator filter dead entries
  themselves. A raw count only grows until the vertex is walked, so skipping
  every round hides hubs whose neighbours died (com-Youtube under GKS: +14 %
  iterations). Full walks therefore alternate with the skipping rounds and audit
  the skip they replace; a clean audit doubles the skipping rounds before the
  next one (1..8), a hidden eligible vertex resets them to 1. Do not remove the
  audit. Never active while the cache is on or undecided, nor under
  `APXCHOL_INCREMENTAL_DEGREE_SPARSE=0|1` (exact references).
  `APXCHOL_PRUNE_SKIP=<factor>` overrides the factor, `0` disables the rule,
  `APXCHOL_PRUNE_SKIP_TRACE=1` prints the audits.
- `factor_options.sampler` / `--sampler` selects `gks` (default) or
  `trace_cycle`. Trace-cycle emits at most d edges from a degree-d star and
  retains GKS for degree below three. CPU setup and full GPU-owned setup support
  it; it rejects forced CPU-shadow/export combinations instead of silently
  substituting a backend. The owned device sampler covers normal and oversized
  rows and retains per-session moment scratch. Trace-cycle retains positive
  subnormals; finite zero neighbors or unrepresentable numerical plans use
  input-only GKS fallback with the original seed before sampling. Invalid inputs
  and overflow remain errors. Device traces report these numerical fallbacks.
  (`heavy_core_k2` was removed 2026-09-17: same fill and iterations within one
  of trace-cycle, setup +4.6%, one-RHS total +2.1%, 16-RHS total -1.8% on 22
  matrices; `benchmarks/daint/SAMPLERS.md` keeps its published measurements.)
- GPU trace-cycle uses item-based emission for small rows; the superseded
  per-pivot sampler and `APXCHOL_GPU_TRACE_ITEMS` opt-out are retired.
- Trace-cycle rows with more than 128 canonical neighbors use cooperative warp
  moment/prefix scans, cutoff reduction, parent searches and edge emission.
  Suffix maxima repair floating CDF monotonicity. Lane zero retains the core
  shuffle; light parents use indexed direct-CDF draws after its actual rejection
  consumption. Intended laws are unchanged; floating folds/cutoffs and seeded
  factors can differ from CPU. Input-only fallback and range guards remain.
  Owned oversized-only rounds use one warp per block; mixed rounds retain larger blocks.
- The owned selector uses degree/hash/id priority, all ties at the degree
  quantile, and at most four immutable decision/commit passes with stable
  unresolved-candidate compaction. It guarantees independence and progress,
  not maximality or the CPU regional selected set. Generic CSR selection keeps
  its regional law. Seed and actual round index reach the owned priority rule.
- Owned elimination packs rows of at most 128 physical slots into local batches;
  oversized rows keep the global stable-sort fallback. Counts publish batch
  descriptors and compact offsets; one warp emits each batch into its original
  disjoint factor/fill slots. Preserve ordered duplicate sums, raw degree,
  canonical weight/neighbor order, prefix/upper_bound sampling and random streams.
  Compact-owned row counts and dead-fill excess scratch reuse retain provenance
  and lifetime checks. Requested and retained scratch enter memory preflight.
- The owned loop makes one CPU-style sparsification decision at its first
  low-yield selection boundary. The existing residual switch/traffic gate
  controls directed coalescing, one bucket/ordinal forest and conditional
  Bernoulli/HT sampling; normalization keeps full-stream ordered 16384-item
  chunks. Revoke and reprepare the preview without advancing the numerical
  round. Rebuild degrees/fingerprints and the handback edge-accounting basis;
  preserve active/excess and factor append state. Generic pre-import inputs
  retain the CPU coalescer fallback. Validate `GpuOwnedSparsify.*` on device;
  source integration requires fresh native and performance validation.
- Device finalization supports the existing fp16/drop contracts and omits host
  factor values only for a unique internal consuming owner. Private finalized
  factors build dataflow plans on device; generic capsules retain host planning
  and validation. Host factor metadata remains. Optional GPU forest-tail thinning
  is not included; CPU residual sparsification remains unchanged. Adopted factors
  and device-built operators complete their queued setup work before returning.
  Host-built setup keeps its existing synchronization boundaries; the common
  benchmark harness synchronizes every measured API boundary. Optional receipts/events use
  existing verbose or setup/frontend trace flags. Memory, nnz and SpTRSV statistics
  keep their own controls. No private experiment compile definition is required.
- Validate the owned path with `GpuBoundedSelection.*`, `GpuDirectCsc.*`,
  `GpuOperatorCsr.*`, `GpuOwnedPrefix.*`, `GpuFactorFinalize.*`, the audited round
  and adoption fixtures, and sanitizer/leak checks. Source integration is not
  performance acceptance: compare the default route against current main and
  the owned route against its frozen research reference, with original-system
  quality, setup, solve, one-RHS total, RSS and owner memory.
- CUDA PCG reuses the host RHS buffer for the solution download and unpermutation
  only after its upload has completed and no further host RHS reads remain.
- GPU allocation cleanup shares the internal `detail/cuda_device_scope.h`
  best-effort device switch/restore guard. Preserve each caller's enable condition
  and early no-op: disabled or pristine lifetimes must not initialize CUDA.
- Keep substantial mechanisms: compensated factor dropping, GPU long-row
  segmentation, critical-tail solving, incremental degrees, and connectivity
  preserving residual sparsification. Standalone residual coalescing policy
  is retired; coalescing and multiplicity remain sparsification internals.
- Residual importance normalization uses fixed
  16,384-item ordered partial sums followed by an ordered block fold, with one
  persistent OpenMP team for the initial sum and up to six updates. The same
  ordered input gives the same normalization at every thread count; arithmetic
  intentionally differs from the legacy global serial fold. Final statistics,
  conditional Bernoulli/HT law and connectivity backbone remain unchanged.
  `ResidualBlockedNormalization.*` and `ResidualBlockedGraph/*.*` check the new
  contract. No runtime knob is added. The implementation was validated on
  the recorded platform before integration; see [the normalization history](docs/implementation-history.md#blocked-normalization)
  for the bounded setup improvement and the separate limits of the timing study.
- Full symmetric CSC inputs with unique sorted indices construct directed pool
  incidences by column ownership; upper incidences use canonical lower weights.
  Duplicate, uncompressed, one-triangle or unpaired stored patterns retain the
  general graph builder. No extra public builder or runtime knob is exposed.
- Lazy segmented adjacency reservations request THPs only when the kernel's
  reported PMD granularity is at most 2 MiB (cached once); larger or unknown
  granularities use `MADV_NOHUGEPAGE`. This preserves the measured laptop
  benefit while preventing Daint's 512 MiB first-touch inflation. Intermediate
  geometries are not claimed performance-optimal. Fully sized factor/output
  buffers retain their separate `big_alloc` policies; there is no runtime knob.
- Pooled compaction must remain inside the factorizer's collective `omp single`:
  moving its decision to independently arriving workers can diverge barriers.
  Preserve factor-buffer lifetime through assembly and release transients at
  their last use. `clear()` does not release vector capacity.

## Benchmarks and experiments

Committed Daint and laptop results are historical snapshots tied to their
recorded sources, inputs and protocols. Preserve each snapshot's denominator;
do not describe it as current-library performance or silently relabel profiles.
Preserve historical outcomes, effective versus requested threads, and source/binary/cell hashes.
[benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md) defines runner/solver contracts;
use the existing harness. Rendering runs no benchmarks.
An explicit `--solver` must name a solver compiled into that benchmark binary;
unknown or unavailable solvers exit 2 before matrix loading, without a CSV row.
`--solver none` is accepted only for input exports and component inspection.
Julia/CMG operator exports share the harness's staged cache writer: only a
successful export is published; failed or interrupted writes leave no cache.
ParAC retains its separate timing-accounted adapter cache.
`benchmarks/weighted_inputs.py` generates four explicit weighted graph variants;
`sweep_fair.py --matrix-manifest` loads additional hash-bound input records.
Each graph component receives a backbone tree. Weight distributions and seeds
are recorded in cell metadata, and changed input identities invalidate resume.

Grade **every retained original-system residual** against the common tolerance.
Calibration failures/caps must not trigger fallback retained runs. A median
repetition selects timing fields only. Whole-cell/prerequisite deadlines are
not lower bounds on individual solves. Report setup, solve, memory and reuse
separately; preserve complete timing boundaries and separate CUDA initialization.
Do not wrap timed calls in `VramSampler`: nvidia-smi polling perturbs GH200 setup.
Measure VRAM separately; missing peaks stay unknown.

ParAC: patch0005 uses Neumaier compensation for the Physics producer global
sum; preserve ordering, per-column sums and both ±1e-9 thresholds. External
checkouts require patching before rebuilding. Physics inputs with positive
stored off-diagonals are unsupported for original-operator comparison,
**before** preparation cache hits or fallbacks.
Patch0006 shares the Graph producer with an in-memory entry. CPU Graph/AMD charges
required transform, ordering/permutation and explicit final GC; common input read
and measured final serialization are separate. Require finite reconciled intervals
and source/schema-bound caches; keep inclusive diagnostics. Physics/GPU complete
timing and native adapter/factor/workspace charges remain unchanged.

Native CMG is opt-in via `APXCHOL_CMG_NATIVE_BIN` and `benchmarks/cmg/native`.
Keep private generated sources untracked. Its generated core is serial;
record affinity/effective threads and the `cmg_packed/original-operator` label.
Preserve independent returned-solution checks, explicit RHS support and the
canonical exception in the benchmark README.

Use `--warmup N`, `--repeat R` and existing thread-scaling scopes as needed.
`--dump-rhs` exports the common RHS without solving. `render_snapshot.py`
provides the common presentation path. Its optional `--fill-cells` consumes an
explicit derived store with common `2*offdiag(L)/offdiag(A)` fill; preserve missing
counts, source solve status and reported rounding uncertainty.

Timing campaigns record immutable source/binary/input identities, affinity,
repetitions, raw outputs and the entire planned denominator. Balance arm order
and use null controls. Concurrent ranks on one node are not independent machines.
Separate correctness, timing validity and the performance decision. Preserve
original verdicts and valid observations when a subset fails; label later
subset analysis retrospective. A faster solve with slower one-RHS total is a
tradeoff. Never multiply isolated ratios into a cumulative speedup claim.

## Workspace and handoff

Check the active branch and dirty state before editing. The current checkout
may be an older research branch even when `origin/main` has newer work. Give
each editing agent explicit file/worktree ownership and keep laptop timing
in one lane.

Keep work that must survive shutdown in persistent paths, not `/tmp` clones
or worktrees. Before handoff record each active branch/commit, dirty patch,
result path, exact remote job ID/status, and next action in one durable local
ledger. Confirm the checkpoint exists. An agent's assignment is not evidence
that implementation or a cluster job started.

`data/`, `results/` and `benchmarks/results/` are ignored. Committed historical
extracts, coverage and source/protocol metadata live in `benchmarks/daint/`;
private campaign stores, operational runbooks and coordination ledgers stay
outside tracked source. Public results require explicit publication approval.
`results/cells/` is a generated local store, not automatically the source of
published Daint data. Renderers default to ignored `results/plots/` previews;
publication requires an explicitly selected store and output.
`thread_scaling.py --compact` renders up to three scoped matrices as absolute
setup/solve times and log-log speedups, with separate extract names; full-study
figures and data remain available. The retired
laptop snapshot and its 612 legacy T16 cells are preserved in
`benchmarks/archive/laptop-20260908/`; do not blend them into current results.
Keep internal reports and private comparison sources outside tracked files. Do not publish them or contact collaborators
without authorization. Preserve source and evidence before any worktree
retirement; obey the user's destructive-operation approval requirements.
