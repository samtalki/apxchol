/* Exception-safe C ABI for apxchol (pure C99; the `apxchol_c` CMake target).
 *
 * Every fallible call returns an apxchol_status. SUCCESS (0) and
 * NOT_CONVERGED (1) both write every requested output: NOT_CONVERGED means the
 * solution and info were written but the relative residual is not below tol.
 * It is never a relaxed acceptance. Every other status is an error: a call
 * that returns a new handle sets it to NULL, an info or stats output whose
 * struct_size matches is zeroed except struct_size (one whose struct_size
 * does not match is left untouched and decides the status), and other
 * outputs are unspecified. When error_message is non-NULL and
 * error_capacity > 0, a NUL-terminated (possibly truncated) message is
 * written ("" on SUCCESS).
 *
 * No C++ exception crosses this boundary. Conditions that terminate the
 * process instead of returning a status: a factor or pool offset beyond
 * edge_index (2^32-1 by default; rebuild with APXCHOL_64BIT_EDGE_INDICES=ON)
 * aborts, and an exception escaping an OpenMP region calls std::terminate.
 *
 * Input: a square CSC matrix with int64 colptr[n+1] and rowval/nzval[nnz],
 * nnz = colptr[n] - index_base, index_base 0 or 1 for both index arrays. Rows
 * may be unsorted; duplicates are summed. The caller must supply live buffers
 * of at least the documented lengths; this ABI cannot discover allocation
 * sizes or validate arbitrary pointers. Inputs must not be mutated during a call. The matrix must satisfy the
 * operator contract of apxchol/operator_class.h (Laplacian, SDDM or a
 * lumpable M-matrix); it is validated, never reinterpreted. Limits in every
 * build: n <= 2^31-1 and nnz <= 2^31-1.
 *
 * Laplacian systems return the min-norm solution (unless an SDDM factor is
 * adopted, see apxchol_solver_create_from_factor); the right-hand side must be
 * compatible with every connected component (it is not projected).
 *
 * A solver handle is not safe for overlapping calls; distinct handles may be
 * used concurrently from different threads. A factor handle is immutable: the
 * calls that read it may overlap, but destroy must not overlap any of them.
 * b, x0 and x (and r, z) may be the same pointer; partial overlap is
 * undefined.
 *
 * Versioning: every struct carries struct_size, which the caller sets to
 * sizeof(struct) from the header it compiled against. This library accepts
 * the sizes of its own header; a larger (newer) size returns UNSUPPORTED and a
 * smaller one INVALID_ARGUMENT. */
