/// Core index types for the apxchol library.
///
/// Since apxchol owns all sparse storage (sparse_csc, vec_pool — no Eigen factor),
/// it is NOT bound by Eigen's signed-`StorageIndex` requirement, so both index
/// types are UNSIGNED. Two roles, deliberately different sizes:
///
///   node_index : vertex ids. n << 4.29B for any realistic graph, so this stays
///                32-bit even under APXCHOL_64BIT_INDICES -- the large row-index
///                arrays (factor inner indices) never double.
///   edge_index : cumulative column offsets and edge ids, which DO reach billions
///                on dense factors / over-allocated pools -> the one widened by
///                APXCHOL_64BIT_INDICES (com-Orkut's factor needs it).
///
/// Two independent width knobs (CMake options of the same name):
///   APXCHOL_64BIT_EDGE_INDICES -> edge_index = uint64. Needed when the factor
///       nnz / pool size exceeds 2^31 even though the vertex count does not
///       (e.g. com-Orkut: 3.07M nodes but a >2.1e9-nnz factor).
///   APXCHOL_64BIT_NODE_INDICES -> node_index = uint64. Needed for graphs with
///       more than ~4.29B vertices. Since #edges >= #vertices, a 64-bit node
///       index implies a 64-bit edge index -- this knob AUTO-WIDENS edges too.
///   APXCHOL_64BIT_INDICES (deprecated) -> alias for the EDGE knob (the realistic
///       overflow case; keeps node_index 32-bit, the memory-optimal default).
///
/// Unsigned-safety rules (the surface is tiny -- audited):
///   * `npos = (T)-1` is a valid sentinel, but ONLY compared with `==`/`!=`
///     (never `< 0`, which is always false for unsigned).
///   * reverse loops use `for (i = n; i-- > 0; )` (or `~i`), never `i >= 0`.
///   * offsets are added as cumulative non-negative sums (asserted not to wrap);
///     never `(lo+hi)/2` (use `lo + (hi-lo)/2`) and never a diff that can go < 0.
