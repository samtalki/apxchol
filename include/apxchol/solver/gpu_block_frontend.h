/// numerical owner's immutable current CSR through a private generation token.
/// Both routes use the same degree cap and block-region selection policy.
/// Public GPU solves enable this as part of their complete route. Low-level
/// diagnostics use APXCHOL_GPU_BLOCK_FRONTEND=1|on|force (unset disables).
/// The implementation lives in src/cuda_block_frontend.cu; the default CPU setup
/// has no topology capture or device-allocation overhead.
