"""Which stored cells a code change invalidated -- so a re-sweep refills only those.

Every cell records the `git_sha` it was produced at (see PROV in sweep_fair.py), and
the sweep is resume-safe. Together they let the fair sweep perform a limited,
non-destructive re-run:

    python3 benchmarks/stale_cells.py            # report, change nothing
    python3 benchmarks/sweep_fair.py ...         # replaces stale cells as runs finish

``--delete`` remains an optional, recoverable cleanup tool. It is not required
before a fair sweep: the runner uses the predicate in this module and leaves an
old cell in place until its replacement run has returned.

A cell is stale when a rule below applies to it AND the commit that rule names is
NOT an ancestor of the cell's git_sha -- i.e. the cell was produced before the fix.
Independently, schema-1 timeout cells are stale because they do not persist the cap
needed to interpret the outcome numerically. Add a rule whenever a change alters what
a solver measures or which matrix it solves; that is cheaper than re-running the suite
and safer than remembering by hand.

The report always states the denominator first: total cells, then the filter.
