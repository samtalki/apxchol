"""Single fair runner for ALL matrix families (grids + SuiteSparse + IPM), on
either device (--device cpu | gpu). Both write the SAME per-cell JSON store
(results/cells/<family>/<mid>__<solver>__<cfg>__t16__<device>.json) and are
RESUME-SAFE: a reusable terminal cell is skipped, while a terminal cell invalidated
by the current stale rules is re-run and replaced only after its runner finishes.
fair_charts.py / gpu_charts.py / combined_charts.py all read this one store.

Every matrix DECLARES how it is to be read (runner_common: kind=graph|operator),
and the binary requires that declaration on the command line — nothing here
guesses. kind=graph builds L = D - A from the file's |values| (the system a graph
file defines); kind=operator solves the published matrix as it stands, diagonal
included. Each matrix prints one interpretation line, and every cell records it
under matrix_meta. External solvers (ParAC, AC/AC2) are handed that same operator
through --dump-mtx rather than re-reading the registry file themselves.

Singular-Laplacian families (grids, SuiteSparse graphs) now run UNSHIFTED, on the
ORIGINAL singular L (no --reg-rel). The benchmark grounds singular Laplacians with
a symmetric multi-component Dirichlet pin (one pin per connected component) and
scores every solver's true residual against the original L, so multigrid reaches
1e-8 without the eps*I perturbation that --reg-rel used to add. (reg-rel was
masking real solver limitations -- e.g. AMGCL floors on the disconnected
as-Skitter -- by solving a better-conditioned L+eps*I.) IPM normal-equation
matrices are already strictly SDDM and likewise run unshifted. CMG remains the
lone reg-rel solver on the singular families (it is scored on L+eps*I there, and
on the published operator itself for kind=operator); everything else in this
sweep is reg-free.

EVERY solver in the comparison runs from here, so one sweep fills every cell:
apxchol + the C++ competitors in-process, ParAC via parac_runner.py, AC/AC2 via
benchmarks/julia/bench_laplacians.jl and CMG via cmg_matlab_runner.py (canonical
MATLAB CMG in the matlab-deps container). --no-julia / --no-cmg / --no-parac opt
out individually; --headline-only restricts the apxchol config list (AC/AC2 are
dropped only by an explicit --no-julia).
A solver that cannot take a given matrix emits an explicit `n/a` cell carrying
the reason, never a silent gap.

  # CPU axis (default):
  systemd-inhibit --what=sleep:idle --mode=block python3 benchmarks/sweep_fair.py
  # GPU axis (needs the CUDA build; apxchol uses the GPU-resident PCG):
  python3 benchmarks/sweep_fair.py --device gpu

ParAC runs IN-PROCESS via parac_runner.py (graph+physics on both axes), emitting
into the same store. Shared harness (hardened sh, matrix registry, cell store,
CSV parse, VRAM sidecar) lives in runner_common.py. Schema-2 timeout cells persist
the exact wall-clock cap as `timeout_cap_s`; the charting pipeline never reconstructs
that lower bound from later timings.

    in-process solvers was a property of two code paths happening to match — not
    something the run demonstrated. `--operator` makes the Julia driver read the
    matrix that `--dump-mtx` wrote, i.e. the exact operator every in-process
    solver was given, and solve THAT: approxchol_lap on a singular Laplacian
    (recovering A = -offdiag(L)), approxchol_sddm on a full-rank operator.

    Julia driver says so on stderr and emits its n/a sentinel row (iters/rel_res
    = -1); we lift that sentence into the cell, so the n/a carries its reason
