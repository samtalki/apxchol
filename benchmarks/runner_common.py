"""Shared harness for the benchmark runners.

One canonical copy of the pieces that were duplicated (with drift) across
sweep_fair.py / parac_runner.py / thread_scaling.py / fill_pass.py /
level_stats.py:

  - sh()           hardened subprocess harness: process-group kill on timeout
                   (the orphan-on-timeout bug fix, 2026-06-11), optional env and
                   per-call `ulimit -v` memory cap, and core dumps disabled by
                   default.
  - matrix registry  GRIDS/SS/IPM + matrix_args()/margs_for() — the single list
                   the per-runner MATS were drifting copies of.
  - cell store     cell_path/emit_cell/cell_status/cell_done with the terminal
                   status set as a PARAMETER (the per-runner sets deliberately
                   differ: parac_runner retries failed/timeout, sweep_fair doesn't).
  - parse_csv/classify  the benchmark-binary CSV row -> metrics dict + status.
  - VramSampler    nvidia-smi peak-VRAM sidecar thread (GPU axis), parameterized
                   by the compute-process name to match.
  - ParAC constants + the AMD-reorder cache path helper.

All runners (sweep_fair, thread_scaling, fill_pass, level_stats,
selector_levels) import these helpers rather than carrying their own copies.

# ── matrix registry ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every entry DECLARES its kind. Two things can live in a .mtx file and they
# define two different linear systems:
#
#   kind="graph"     the file is an adjacency / pattern matrix. The system it
#                    defines is the graph Laplacian L = D - A, assembled from
#                    |value| (unit weights for a `pattern` file). That IS the
#                    system a graph file defines, so building it is not a
#                    deviation from the published data.
#   kind="operator"  the file is an already-assembled Laplacian / SDDM operator.
#                    The system it defines is the matrix itself, and we solve it
#                    exactly as published, diagonal included.
#
# The declaration is EXPLICIT and never auto-detected. A heuristic cannot tell
# the two apart: kron_g500-logn16 stores integer values that are edge weights,
# apache2 stores values that are an assembled operator, and both are "a
# symmetric valued .mtx". Letting the benchmark guess would let it silently
# change which problem the whole suite reports on. Anything undeclared raises
# (see kind_of) rather than falling back to a default.
#
# `source` is a separate axis: where the matrix comes from (a generated grid vs
# a file), not how its values are to be read.
#
# Kinds below are grounded in the files themselves (census 2026-08-20, stored
# diagonal vs sum |off-diagonal| per row):
#   operator — a stored, strictly positive diagonal on every row:
#     ecology1       max rel. deviation 0        (published as an exact Laplacian)
#     parabolic_fem  6.4e-6                      (SDDM: small but real excess on
#                                                 EVERY row, so it is full-rank —
#                                                 "Laplacian to rounding" it is not)
#     apache2        10.4% worst row             (SDDM)
#     thermal2       143% worst row, mean 4.1e-4 (SDDM)
#     G3_circuit     16876% worst row, mean 161% (SDDM, large diagonal excess)
#     iter00x0       IPM normal equations, positive diagonal on every row
#   graph — no usable diagonal at all (`pattern` files store none; kron_g500
#     stores one on 327 of 65536 rows, i.e. self-loops, not an operator).
# ParAC's own benchmark splits its matrices exactly this way ("physics matrices:
# used as-is" vs "graph matrices: build Laplacian from adjacency"), and four of
# our five operator files are on its physics list.
#
# ── the second axis: the grounding CLASS ───────────────────────────────────────
# `kind` says how to READ the file. `cls` says what the assembled operator IS,
# and it decides two things the whole comparison rests on:
#
#   cls="laplacian"  singular: the constant vector is in the nullspace. Needs a
#                    grounding (a Dirichlet pin, or apxchol's mean-centring), and
#                    its solution and residual are only defined modulo constants,
#                    so both get mean-centred before scoring.
#   cls="sddm"       full-rank: a unique solution. Handed to every solver
#                    untouched — no pin, no mean-centring. Pinning one would
#                    change the system; mean-centring its UNIQUE solution
#                    corrupts it and puts a floor under the reported residual.
#
# The two axes are NOT independent, which is why only kind="operator" declares a
# class: a kind="graph" matrix is assembled as L = D - A and is a singular
# Laplacian BY CONSTRUCTION (measured 2026-08-21 on all 18 graph entries:
# max|rowsum| is exactly 0.0). An assembled operator file can be either, and
# nothing in the file says which, so it must be declared. class_of() raises on an
# undeclared operator exactly as kind_of() raises on an undeclared kind.
#
# This replaces a RATIO HEURISTIC (`is_laplacian_operator`, benchmark.cpp, deleted
# 2026-08-21) that called a matrix Laplacian when max|rowsum| / max|diag| < 1e-10.
# That test cannot work on a family carrying a uniform diagonal shift: the IPM
# normal equations all carry +1e-6 I, so their row sums NEVER vanish and only
# max|diag| moves as the barrier tightens — which slid the ratio across the
# threshold mid-family (measured, this registry's own files):
#     iter0010  4.396623e-10  -> SDDM       (correct, but 4.4x from flipping)
#     iter0020  9.988164e-12  -> LAPLACIAN  WRONG: pinned, RHS mean-centred
#     iter0030  8.242149e-12  -> LAPLACIAN  WRONG
#     iter0040  1.116573e-11  -> LAPLACIAN  WRONG
#     ecology1  8.881784e-17  -> LAPLACIAN  (correct, 6 orders of margin)
# The declared class below is asserted against the binary's own structural scan
# (apxchol::scan_operator, per-row and per-row-scaled rather than global), and a
# mismatch is a hard error — see the `--class` handling in benchmark.cpp.
#
# Declared classes, and the structural scan that must agree with them
# (audit 2026-08-21; `excess` = rows with a positive diagonal excess, `deficient`
